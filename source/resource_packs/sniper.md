We created Sniper Rifles, in vanilla Minecraft!
You don't need any mods or command blocks, you only have to enable this Resource Pack.
You can play on your favorite servers or singleplayer worlds with an epic sniper rifle instead of a bow!
The Sniper Rifle Pack has custom models, textures, names, and even sounds!

## Installation instructions
