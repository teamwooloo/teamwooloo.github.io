Welcome to *G. A. T. O. S.*!

*G. A. T. O. S.* Is a very challenging map, where you have to think creative and use your minecraft knowledge.
 The objective is to Get At The Other Side, using the items given to you.

This map contains 15 different and challenging levels for you to complete and a smooth hint and restart mechanism.
It is tested tons of times by our Beta Testers, so don't worry about bugs, everything you can do to complete a level,
 is what you are meant to do to complete a level.

*Hope you enjoy!*

~Team Wooloo
