Welcome to the Who's Your Daddy map!

Together with the amazing Grian we are proud to present our brand new map. Who's Your Daddy in Vanilla Minecraft!
It has everything of the original game, but then with way way more content! There are new rooms, new areas, way more deaths and items and
so many things you can do!

Below you will find two downloads (In the Green boxes). The first one will be the map. You only need this when hosting the server/LAN world.
The second download is the Resource Pack. All players have to enable this Resource Pack to see the items.

IMPORTANT: If you are a YOUTUBER you have to copy this INTO THE DESCRIPTION:

    Map Made By: http://www.youtube.com/TeamWooloo and http://www.youtube.com/c/Grian

IF YOU DONT you will be added to an AUTOMATIC KILL LIST for any future updates and future maps. We are sorry we have to do this but our
creations have been abused so many times in the past we have to take serious steps to protect them. PLEASE DONT FORGET TO CREDIT!

But anyways. Here are the downloads. Have fun!
