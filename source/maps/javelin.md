Welcome to the Wooloo Games! In this episode, we recreate Javelin Throw, in vanilla Minecraft!

Abusing some Minecraft Mechanics, and combining that with a Resource Pack and some Command Blocks,
we made it into a fully functioning Minigame for you to play!

Please Note: Play on Minecraft 1.9

Installation Instructions:

To play, you have to have both the Resource Pack, and the World installed. In Singleplayer the Resource Pack will be automaticly installed,
so you don't have to download it when training or going for a high score. In multiplayer however, everybody needs to have enabled the Resource Pack.
