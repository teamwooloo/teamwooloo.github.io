### Welcome to SkyGrind, next level Skyblock!

It's Skyblock, but with no cobblestone generators, and with spawners that provide you with resources!
You are also not just stuck to one island, but for each quest you complete you get a new island!

This map contains:

- 20 Areas for you to explore
- 18 Quests for you to complete
- 8 Spawners for you to farm at
- 1 Custom Stronghold for you to fight through
- 1 Epic Fight against the Enderdragon!

It's for 1 - 4 players, and build for Minecraft version 1.8 (release).
