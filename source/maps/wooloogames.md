Welcome to the Wooloo Games!

The series where we recreate Olympic Sports in Minecraft! So far, we have created Javelin Throw and Competitive Swimming!

Please Note: Play on Minecraft 1.9

Installation Instructions:

To play, you have to have both the Resource Pack, and the World installed. In Singleplayer the Resource Pack will be automaticly installed,
so you don't have to download it when training or going for a high score. In multiplayer however, everybody needs to have enabled the Resource Pack.
