## Welcome to CHORUS CHAOS!

A Minecraft minigame we worked on for the past 2 weeks or so!

Dodge chorus plants, collect points. Get the highest score you can possibly get!

This map requires Minecraft 1.9 Snapshot 15w35b+ !

PLEASE NOTE:

- Don't see the item frames?! Relog!! That should fix the issue.
  If you click start it will bug out the game (fixable by relogging as well)!!
- No hearts spawning? Just let yourself die and respawn (After you've relogged).
  This is caused by an annoying 1.9 bug that makes it not load entities.
  It's like a 1 in 15 chance when entering the shop and going back.
- Play on Minecraft 1.9 Snapshot 15w35b+
- If you play this with friends (You can!) please switch the lever on the right of the platform to "Multiplayer".
- There's an option to turn particles off in the shop above the door.
- Play around with your FOV (Escape menu option) and see which kind of view you like the best!
  70 - 80 is nice, but going Quake Pro makes you able to also see the side of the screen!
- If you are recording for youtube copy-paste the following in your description:
