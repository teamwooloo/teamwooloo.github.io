Hey Minecrafter!

Today we proudly present our new map: Guardian Boss Fight!
You have to shoot his spikes, while dodging attacks that he shoots at you!
Shoot all Spikes 5 times, and you win!
But if you die 3 times, he will destroy the city! Can you save the citizens?

Be Sure to use Snapshot 14w26c+ for this map to work!

Shout out to Bouwer2100 for reporting bugs, :D !

Good Luck defeating the Guardian!

~Team Wooloo
